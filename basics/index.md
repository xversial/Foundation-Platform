## Basics

Platform 5 isn't just a CMS system. It's a flexible and extensible application which provides a solid base.

By default you can quickly get started by managing users, content and your settings. Creating a new theme is easy and if Platform 5 doesn't provide something you'd like to see, you can easily extend it with your own custom extensions which can be installed through Composer.

This documentation will get you quick-started with Platform 5's basic functionality and will help you build your own custom Platform 5 extensions.
