## Basics

Platform 2 isn't just a CMS system. It's a flexible and extensible application which provides a solid base.

By default you can quickly get started by managing users, content and your settings. Creating a new theme is easy and if Platform 2 doesn't provide something you'd like to see, you can easily extend it with your own custom extensions which can be installed through Composer.

This documentation will get you quick-started with Platform 2's basic functionality and will help you build your own custom Platform 2 extensions.

### Dashboard

The back-end dashboard which comes with the Platform 2 application gives you a good starting point for managing your site. It's a flexible CMS on which you can build your own functionality.

By default the dashboard provides functionality for managing pages, content, users, menus, extensions and your settings. You can add more functionality or alter functionality by adding your own extensions.
