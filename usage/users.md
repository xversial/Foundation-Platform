## Users

The users extension is used to find and edit information about your application's users. This extension contains two main sections, users and groups, which allow you to search, find, create, edit and delete users and groups. You will also find user and group permission settings within the create and edit pages of these sections.

### Users

Platform 2 provides some basic user management functionality like adding, editing and deleting users as well as user registration and setting users to an inactive state.

Besides the functionality that Platform 2 provides by default, the users extensions comes with a lot of additional functionality. Platform 2 comes with all of the power of [Sentry 3](http://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry), a simple and powerful authorization and authentication package which gives you even more functionality to interact with your users.

### Groups

Because Platform 2 comes with [Sentry 3](http://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry) installed, you also get easy group management over your users. You can assign users to groups by clicking on the edit button of a user. Later on you can add specific permissions to groups.

### Permissions

Permissions can both be set on users and groups. You can assign permissions by editing a user or group and clicking the permissions tab on the right above. Here you'll get a listing of all the available permissions for your Platform 2 application.

Permissions are usually added through extensions. You can read more about how to add permissions through extensions [here](#configuring-extensions).
