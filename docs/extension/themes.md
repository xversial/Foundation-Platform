###Themes

----------

The Themes extension is where you can manage your application themes.  Have a new theme you want to enable? Want to edit available options within your enabled theme? This extension is where all the administrative theme actions are done. View all your available themes for your frontend and backend of the site and choose which you want enabled.  Some themes will even give you the option to edit some of their styles so you can modify the look easily with an override.
