#### Dashboard

The back-end dashboard which comes with the Platform 2 application gives you a good starting point for managing your site. It's a flexible CMS on which you can build your own functionality.

By default the dashboard provides functionality for managing pages, content, users, menus, extensions and your settings. You can add more functionality or alter functionality by adding your own extensions.
