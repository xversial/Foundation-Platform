#### Pages

Just like in a normal CMS you can add pages to your application.

Platform 3 provides support to store the content for these pages in the database or make use of the filesystem to use static view files which are part of your theme.

These static view files can include various content sections and prove to be very dynamic.

You can later re-use these view files in other parts of your application.

##### Importing Content

You can import content pieces by using the `@content()` blade structure. This even works with the database type. See [Re-using Content](#content) in the Content section about how to re-use content parts.
