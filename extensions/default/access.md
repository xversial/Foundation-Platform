#### Access

Access is an RBAC extension, it combines three extensions (Users, Roles and Permissions) and combined allows you to manage your application Users, Roles and Permissions easily.

You can specify permissions on roles or on users in case a more custom use case appears.

Besides the functionality that this extension provides by default, it comes with a lot of additional functionality powered by [Cartalyst Sentinel](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentinel), a simple and powerful authorization and authentication package which gives you even more functionality to interact with your Users and Roles.

##### Users

Platform 2 provides some basic user management functionality like adding, editing and deleting users as well as user registration and setting users to an inactive state.

##### Roles

Because Platform 2 comes with [Cartalyst Sentinel](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentinel) installed, you also get easy role management over your users. You can assign users to roles by clicking on the edit button of a user. Later on you can add specific permissions to roles.

##### Permissions

Permissions can both be set on users and roles. You can assign permissions by editing a user or a role and clicking on the permissions tab.

Here you'll get a listing of all the available permissions for your Platform 2 application.

Permissions are usually added through extensions. You can read more about how to add permissions through extensions [here](#configuring-extensions).
